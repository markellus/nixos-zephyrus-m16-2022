# NixOS configuration for ASUS Zephyrus M16 (Intel 12900H / RTX 3080 Mobile)

This repository contains some configuration files to run NixOS on the ASUS Zephyrus M16 (2022), including some workarounds for audio output, enabling NVidia Optimus, and to make the 165hz display work correctly. This was only tested on my own device with my exact configuration, so use at your own risk!

## Installation

Copy all files to your NixOS configuration folder and use them inside your configuration.nix.  
Or just copy the lines you need into your own configuration files.
